# Mizumi

An Android Epub Reader inspired by Tachiyomi/Mihon to provide a fair reading experience. 
It is an extension to my other project [MizuList](https://github.com/shrimpyvongue/MizuList).
(This branch will be discontinued/paused for the foreseeable future.)

## Features
 - Local source to read local EPUBs
 - Text to speech
 - Allows Synchronization with the account you login which enables auto-tracking with [MizuList](https://github.com/shrimpyvongue/MizuList)

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to [Nina](https://github.com/nanihadesuka) as the [NovelDokusha](https://github.com/nanihadesuka/NovelDokusha) helped me a lot to learn and most of the codebase is built on that.  
Special thanks to JetBrains for creating Kotlin and to the Jetpack Compose team for providing a modern toolkit for building native Android UI.
